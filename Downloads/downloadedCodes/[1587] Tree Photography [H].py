####  Tree Photography  ####

Heading off to the Tree Arboretum of Various Heights, I bring along my camera to snap up a few photos. Ideally, I'd want to take a picture of as many trees as possible, but the taller trees may cover up the shorter trees behind it.
A tree is hidden if it is shorter or the same height as the tree in front.
Given a list of tree heights, create a function which returns "left" or "right", depending on which side allows me to see as many trees as possible.


[Worked Example]

___
tree_photography([1, 3, 1, 6, 5]) ➞ "left"

# If I stand on the left, I can see trees of heights 1, 3 and 6.
# If I stand on the right, I can see trees of heights 5 and 6.
# Return "left" because I would see more trees.

[Examples]

___
tree_photography([5, 6, 5, 4]) ➞ "right"

tree_photography([1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]) ➞ "left"

tree_photography([3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6]) ➞ "left"

[Notes]

There will always be a best side.
