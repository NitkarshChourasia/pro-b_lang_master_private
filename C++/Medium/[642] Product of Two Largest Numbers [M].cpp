####  Product of Two Largest Numbers  ####

Create a function that takes an array and returns the product of the largest and second largest number.


[Examples]

___
product([2, 3, 1, -1, 2]) ➞ 6
// 2 * 3 = 6

product([-2, -2, -1, -1]) ➞ 2
// -2 * - 1 = 2
// Not 1, because you can only use -1 one time.

product([8, 8, 8]) ➞ 64
// 8 * 8 = 64
// You can repeat here because there is only one value.

product([2, 8, 8, 8]) ➞ 16
// 2 * 8 = 16
// Not 64, because you can only use 8 one time.
_____



[Notes]

___
*) Numbers in the array are all integers.

Additionally, is it faster to erase the duplicates first (similar to coded above) or perform the sort first? If I do perform the sort first, is it guaranteed to remain …
