####  Neatly Formatted Math  ####

Given a simple math expression as a string, neatly format it as an equation.


[Examples]

___
formatMath("3 + 4") ➞ "3 + 4 = 7"

formatMath("3 - 2") ➞ "3 - 2 = 1"

formatMath("4 x 5") ➞ "4 x 5 = 20"

formatMath("6 / 3") ➞ "6 / 3 = 2"
_____



[Notes]
