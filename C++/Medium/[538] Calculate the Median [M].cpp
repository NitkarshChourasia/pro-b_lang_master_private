####  Calculate the Median  ####

Create a function that takes an array of numbers and return its median. If the input array is even length, take the average of the two medians, else, take the single median.


[Examples]

___
median([2, 5, 6, 2, 6, 3, 4]) ➞ 4

median([21.4323, 432.54, 432.3, 542.4567]) ➞ 432.4

median([-23, -43, -29, -53, -67]) ➞ -43
_____
