####  Pi to N Decimal Places  ####

Given a number n, write a function that returns PI to n decimal places.


[Examples]

___
myPi(5) ➞ 3.14159

myPi(4) ➞ 3.1416

myPi(15) ➞ 3.141592653589793
_____



[Notes]

___
*) n will not be above 15, to keep this challenge simple.
*) Round up the last digit if the next digit in PI is greater or equal to 5 (see second example above).
*) The return value must be a number, not a string.
___
