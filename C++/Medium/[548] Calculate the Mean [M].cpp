####  Calculate the Mean  ####

Create a function that takes an array of numbers and returns the mean (average) of all those numbers.


[Examples]

___
mean([1, 0, 4, 5, 2, 4, 1, 2, 3, 3, 3]) ➞ 2.55

mean([2, 3, 2, 3]) ➞ 2.50

mean([3, 3, 3, 3, 3]) ➞ 3.00
_____



[Notes]

___
*) Round to two decimal places.
*) You can expect a number ranging from 0 to 10,000.
