####  Reverse Coding Challenge #3  ####

This is a reverse coding challenge. Normally you're given explicit directions with how to create a function. Here, you must generate your own function to satisfy the relationship between the inputs and outputs.
Your task is to create a function that, when fed the inputs below, produces the sample outputs shown.


[Examples]

___
[5, 7, 8, 2, 1], 2 ➞ [1, 1, 0, 0, 1]

[9, 8, 16, 47], 4 ➞ [1, 0, 0, 3]

[17, 11, 99, 55, 23, 1], 5 ➞ [2, 1, 4, 0, 3, 1]

[6, 1], 7 ➞ [6, 1]

[3, 2, 9], 3 ➞ [0, 2, 0]

[48, 22, 0, 19, 33, 100], 10 ➞ [8, 2, 0, 9, 3, 0]

How can I change the value of the elements in a vector?
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4807709/how-can-i-change-the-value-of-the-elements-in-a-vector
I have this code, which reads in input from a file and stores it in a vector. So far, I've gotten it to give me the sum of the values within the vector and give the mea …

std::vector
https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/vector
The elements are stored contiguously, which means that elements can be accessed not only through iterators, but also using offsets to regular pointers to elements. This …
