####  Car Timer 🏎️  ####

A built-in timer inside your car can count the length of your ride in minutes and you have started your ride at 00:00.
Given the number of minutes n at the end of the ride, calculate the current time. Return the sum of digits that the digital timer in the format hh:mm will show at the end of the ride.


[Examples]

___
carTimer(240) ➞ 4
// 240 minutes have passed since 00:00, the current time is 04:00
// Digits sum up is 0 + 4 + 0 + 0 = 4

carTimer(14) ➞ 5
// Digits sum up is 0 + 0 + 1 + 4

carTimer(808) ➞ 14
