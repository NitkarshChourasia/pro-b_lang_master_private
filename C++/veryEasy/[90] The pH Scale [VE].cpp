####  The pH Scale  ####

Given a pH value, return whether that value is "alkaline" (greater than 7), "acidic" (less than 7), or "neutral" (7). Return "invalid" if the value given is less than 0 or greater than 14.



[Examples]

___
pHName(5) ➞ "acidic"

pHName(8.7) ➞ "alkaline"

pHName(7) ➞ "neutral"
_____



[Notes]

Values such as 6.9999 and 8.00001 should return "acidic" and "alkaline" respectively.
