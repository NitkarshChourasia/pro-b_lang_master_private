####  Leap Years  ####

A leap year has one day added to February for being synchronized with the seasonal year. A leap year appears with a regular frequency, which is determined by the rule below:
___
*) A year must either be divisible by 400 or divisible by 4 and not 100.
___

Given a year you must implement a function that returns true if it's a leap year, or false if it's not.


[Examples]

___
isLeap(2020) ➞ true
// Exactly divided by 4 and not by 100.

isLeap(1800) ➞ false
// Exactly divided by 4, but is also exactly divided by 100.

isLeap(2000) ➞ true
// Exactly divided by 400.

isLeap(2019) ➞ false
// It can't be exactly divided by 400 or by 4.
_____



[Notes]

___
*) Exactly divided can be interpreted as the remainder of the division is equal to 0.
*) If you get stuck on a challenge, find help in the Resources tab.
*) If you're really stuck, unlock solutions in the Solutions tab.
*) Bonus: Try to implement this function writing a single line of code.
