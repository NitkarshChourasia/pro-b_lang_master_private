####  Not Not Not True  ####

Something which is not true is false, but something which is not not true is true! Create a function where given n number of "not", evaluate whether it's true or false.


[Examples]

___
notNotNot(1, true) ➞ false
// Not true

notNotNot(2, false) ➞ false
// Not not false

notNotNot(6, true) ➞ true
// Not not not not not not true

[Notes]

Even though this challenge can be easily solved through the use of an if | else block, you might want to solve it through the use of a Boolean Logic Operator or a Bitwise Operator, taking the opportunity to become acquainted with these methods (check the Resources tab to find specific links).

It has only one operand, to its right, and inverts it, producing false if its operand is true, and true if its operand is false. Basically, it returns the opposite Bool …
