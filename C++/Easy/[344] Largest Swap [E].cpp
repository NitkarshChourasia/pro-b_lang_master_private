/*
####  Largest Swap  ####

Write a function that takes a two-digit number and determines if it's the largest of two possible digit swaps.
To illustrate:
___
largestSwap(27) ➞ false

largestSwap(43) ➞ true
_____

If 27 is our input, we should return false because swapping the digits gives us 72, and 72 > 27. On the other hand, swapping 43 gives us 34, and 43 > 34.


[Examples]

___
largestSwap(14) ➞ false

largestSwap(53) ➞ true

largestSwap(99) ➞ true
_____



[Notes]

Numbers with two identical digits (third example) should yield true (you can't do better).
