####  Sum of Evenly Divisible Numbers from a Range  ####

Create a function that takes three arguments a, b, c and returns the sum of the numbers that are evenly divided by c from the range a, b inclusive.


[Examples]

___
evenlyDivisible(1, 10, 20) ➞ 0
// No number between 1 and 10 can be evenly divided by 20.

evenlyDivisible(1, 10, 2) ➞ 30
// 2 + 4 + 6 + 8 + 10 = 30

evenlyDivisible(1, 10, 3) ➞ 18
// 3 + 6 + 9 = 18
_____
