####  Derivative of a Function  ####

Create a function that takes numbers b and m as arguments and returns the derivative of the function f(x)=x^b with respect to x at the point where x=m, where b and m are constants.


[Examples]

___
derivative(1, 4) ➞ 1

derivative(3, -2) ➞ 12

derivative(4, -3) ➞ -108
_____



[Notes]

___
*) ^ in the context of this challenge means "to the power of", also known as the "exponent" operator.
*) Assume that b will be a positive integer.
*) m can be any integer, both positive and negative.
*) The return type for this function is an integer.
