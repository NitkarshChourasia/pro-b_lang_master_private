####  Determine If Two Numbers Add up to a Target Value  ####

Given two unique integer arrays a and b, and an integer target value v, create a function to determine whether there is a pair of numbers that add up to the target value v, where one number comes from a and the other comes from b.
Return true if there is a pair that adds up to the target value and false otherwise.


[Examples]

___
sumOfTwo([1, 2], [4, 5, 6], 5) ➞ true

sumOfTwo([1, 2], [4, 5, 6], 8) ➞ true

sumOfTwo([1, 2], [4, 5, 6], 3) ➞ false

sumOfTwo([1, 2], [4, 5, 6], 9) ➞ talse
