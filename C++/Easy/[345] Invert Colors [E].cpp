####  Invert Colors  ####

Create a function that inverts the rgb values of a given tuple.


[Examples]

___
colorInvert([255, 255, 255]) ➞ [0, 0, 0]
// (255, 255, 255) is the color white.
// The opposite is (0, 0, 0), which is black.

colorInvert([0, 0, 0]) ➞ [255, 255, 255]

colorInvert([165, 170, 221]) ➞ [90, 85, 34]
_____
