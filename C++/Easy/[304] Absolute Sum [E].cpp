####  Absolute Sum  ####

Take an array of integers (positive or negative or both) and return the sum of the absolute value of each element.


[Examples]

___
getAbsSum([2, -1, 4, 8, 10]) ➞ 25

getAbsSum([-3, -4, -10, -2, -3]) ➞ 22

getAbsSum([2, 4, 6, 8, 10]) ➞ 30

getAbsSum([-1]) ➞ 1
_____



[Notes]

___
*) The term "absolute value" means to remove any negative sign in front of a number, and to think of all numbers as positive (or zero).
*) All the elements in the given array are integers.
___
