####  Algorithms: Binary Search  ####

Create a function that finds a target number in a list of prime numbers. Implement a binary search algorithm in your function. The target number will be from 2 through 97. If the target is prime then return "yes" else return "no".


[Examples]

___
vector<int> primes = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97]


isPrime(primes, 3) ➞ "yes"

isPrime(primes, 4) ➞ "no"

isPrime(primes, 67) ➞ "yes"

isPrime(primes, 36) ➞ "no"
_____



[Notes]

___
*) You could use built-in functions to solve this, but the point of this challenge is to see if you understand the binary search algorithm.
*) The solution is in the Resources tab.
