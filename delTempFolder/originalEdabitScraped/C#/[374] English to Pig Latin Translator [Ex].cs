####  English to Pig Latin Translator  ####

Pig latin has two very simple rules:

Write two functions to make an English to pig latin translator. The first function TranslateWord(word) takes a single word and returns that word translated into pig latin. The second function TranslateSentence(sentence) takes an English sentence and returns that sentence translated into pig latin.


[Examples]

___
TranslateWord("flag") ➞ "agflay"

TranslateWord("Apple") ➞ "Appleyay"

TranslateWord("button") ➞ "uttonbay"

TranslateWord("") ➞ ""

TranslateSentence("I like to eat honey waffles.") ➞ "Iyay ikelay otay eatyay oneyhay afflesway."

TranslateSentence("Do you think it is going to rain today?") ➞ "Oday ouyay inkthay ityay isyay oinggay otay ainray odaytay?"

[Notes]

___
*) Regular expressions will help you not mess up the punctuation in the sentence.
*) If the original word or sentence starts with a capital letter, the translation should preserve its case (see examples #2, #5 and #6).
