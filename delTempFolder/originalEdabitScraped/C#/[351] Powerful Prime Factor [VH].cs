####  Powerful Prime Factor  ####

Create a function that takes a positive integer and returns a string expressing how the number can be made by multiplying powers of its prime factors.


[Examples]

___
ExpressFactors(2) ➞ "2"

ExpressFactors(4) ➞ "2^2"

ExpressFactors(10) ➞ "2 x 5"

ExpressFactors(60) ➞ "2^2 x 3 x 5"
_____



[Notes]

___
*) All inputs will be positive integers in the range 1 < n < 10,000.
*) If a factor is repeated express it in the form "x^y" where x is the factor and y is the number of repetitions of the factor.
*) If n is a prime number, return n as a string as in example #1 above.
*) Factors should appear in ascending order in the expression.
*) Make sure you include the space either side of the multiplication sign, " x ".
*) Check the Resources if you need to understand Prime Factorization.

The first few prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23. "Prime Factorization" is finding which prime numbers multiply together to make the original number.
