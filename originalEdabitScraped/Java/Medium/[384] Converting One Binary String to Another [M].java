/*
####  Converting One Binary String to Another  ####

Write a function that returns the minimum number of swaps to convert the first binary string into the second.


[Examples]

___
minSwaps("1100", "1001") ➞ 1

minSwaps("110011", "010111") ➞ 1

minSwaps("10011001", "01100110") ➞ 4
_____



[Notes]

___
*) Both binary strings will be of equal length.
*) Both binary strings will have an equal number of zeroes and ones.
*) A swap is switching two elements in a string (swaps do not have to be adjacent).
