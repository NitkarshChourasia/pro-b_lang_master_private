####  Increasing or Decreasing Numbers  ####

Tesh needs your help to find out the increasing or decreasing numbers for a given range.


[Increasing Numbers]

Numbers whose digits, when read from left to right, are never less than the previous digit. See below some examples of increasing numbers:
___
1111
123456
125788999
_____



[Decreasing Numbers]

Numbers whose digits, when read from left to right, are never greater than the previous digit. See below some examples of decreasing numbers:
___
1111
654321
999887521
_____

Create a function that takes a number n and returns total occurrences of all the increasing or decreasing numbers in the range 1 - 10^n.


[Examples]

___
incDec(0) ➞ 1
// 10^0 = 1
// 1 is both increasing and decreasing.

incDec(1) ➞ 10
// 10^1 = 10
// [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10] are both increasing and decreasing numbers.

incDec(3) ➞ 475
_____



[Notes]

To make it even clear, the increasing or decreasing numbers in range 101-200 are:
110, 111, 112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 122, 123, 124, 125, 126, 127, 128, 129, 133, 134, 135, 136, 137, 138, 139, 144, 145, 146, 147, 148, 149, 155, 156, 157, 158, 159, 166, 167, 168, 169, 177, 178, 179, 188, 189, 199, 200
The total will be 47 in this case.
