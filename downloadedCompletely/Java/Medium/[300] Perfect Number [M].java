####  Perfect Number  ####

Create a function that tests whether or not an integer is a perfect number. A perfect number is a number that can be written as the sum of its factors, (equal to sum of its proper divisors) excluding the number itself.
For example, 6 is a perfect number, since 1 + 2 + 3 = 6, where 1, 2, and 3 are all factors of 6. Similarly, 28 is a perfect number, since 1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14 = 28.
