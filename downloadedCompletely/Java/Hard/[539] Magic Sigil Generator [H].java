####  Magic Sigil Generator  ####

A magic sigil is a glyph which represents a desire one wishes to manifest in their lives. There are many ways to create a sigil, but the most common is to write out a specific desire (e.g. "I HAVE WONDERFUL FRIENDS WHO LOVE ME"), remove all vowels, remove any duplicate letters (keeping the last occurence), and then design a glyph from what remains.
Using the sentence above as an example, we would remove duplicate letters:
___
AUFRINDSWHLOVME
_____

And then remove all vowels, leaving us with:
___
FRNDSWHLVM
_____

Create a function that takes a string and removes its vowels and duplicate letters. The returned string should not contain any spaces and be in uppercase.


[Examples]

___
sigilize("i am healthy") ➞ "MLTHY"

sigilize("I FOUND MY SOULMATE") ➞ "FNDYSLMT"

sigilize("I have a job I enjoy and it pays well") ➞ "HVBJNDTPYSWL"
_____



[Notes]

___
*) For duplicate letters the last one is kept.
*) When performing actual sigil magic, you must make your sigils manually.
*) Check the Resources tab for more info on sigils if you're interested in the concept.
