tcs.addOrder("hot cocoa") ➞ "This item is currently unavailable!"
// Tesha's coffee shop does not sell hot cocoa
tcs.addOrder("iced tea") ➞ "This item is currently unavailable!"
// specifying the variant of "iced tea" will help the process

tcs.addOrder("cinnamon roll") ➞  "Order added!"
tcs.addOrder("iced coffee") ➞ "Order added!"
tcs.listOrders ➞ ["cinnamon roll", "iced coffee"]
// the list of all the items in the current order

tcs.dueAmount() ➞ 2.17

tcs.fulfillOrder() ➞ "The cinnamon roll is ready!"
tcs.fulfillOrder() ➞ "The iced coffee is ready!"
tcs.fulfillOrder() ➞ "All orders have been fulfilled!";
// all orders have been presumably served

tcs.listOrders() ➞ []
// an empty array is returned if all orders have been exhausted

tcs.dueAmount() ➞ 0.0
// no new orders taken, expect a zero payable

tcs.cheapestItem() ➞ "lemonade"
tcs.drinksOnly() ➞ ["orange juice", "lemonade", "cranberry juice", "pineapple juice", "lemon iced tea", "vanilla chai latte", "hot chocolate", "iced coffee"]
