####  Choosing a Fuse  ####

A fuse melts when a current in an electrical device exceeds the fuse's rating, breaking the circuit and preventing the heat from building up too much (which can cause a fire). The ideal fuse to choose is higher than the device's current output, yet as close as possible to it as well.
Given a list of fuse ratings, and the device's current output, return which of the fuses is the best for the device.


[Examples]

___
choose_fuse(["3V", "5V", "12V"], "4.5V") ➞ "5V"

choose_fuse(["5V", "14V", "2V"], "5.5V") ➞ "14V"

choose_fuse(["17V", "15V", "12V"], "9V") ➞ "12V"
_____



[Notes]

___
*) You will be given three possible ratings in voltage.
*) Fuses may not be in a sorted order.
*) Assume that there is a valid fuse in every test case
