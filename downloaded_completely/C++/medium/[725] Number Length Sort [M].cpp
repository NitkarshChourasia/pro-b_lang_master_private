####  Number Length Sort  ####

Create a sorting function which sorts numbers not by numerical order, but by number length! This means sorting numbers with the least amount of digits first, up to the numbers with the most digits.


[Examples]

___
numberLenSort([1, 54, 1, 2, 463, 2]) ➞ [1, 1, 2, 2, 54, 463]

numberLenSort([999, 421, 22, 990, 32]) ➞ [22, 32, 999, 421, 990]

numberLenSort([9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 31, 2, 1, 3]) ➞ [9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 2, 1, 3, 31]

[Notes]

If two numbers have the same number of digits, return them in the order they first appeared (this makes it different to just sorting the numbers normally).
