####  Uno (Part 2)  ####

This problem is a continuation of Uno Part 1 (although you don't need to complete that problem to complete this one).
It's your turn to play again. Create a function that takes as its arguments (1) your hand (an array of cards), and (2) the face-up card. In Uno, you are able to play a card from your hand if either:
___
*) One of the card colors in your hand matches the face-up card's color.
*) One of the card numbers in your hand matches the face-up card's number.
___

Write a function that will return:



[Examples]

___
decision(["yellow 3", "red 3"], "red 10") ➞ "Uno!"

decision(["blue 1"], "blue 5") ➞ "You won!"

decision(["blue 1", "green 2", "yellow 4", "red 2"], "blue 5") ➞ "Keep going..."
_____



[Notes]

There will not be more than one playable card in each hand.
