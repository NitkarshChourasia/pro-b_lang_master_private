####  Car Park Exit  ####

You are stuck in a multi-storey car parking lot. Your task is to exit the carpark using only the staircases. Exit is always at the bottom right of the ground floor.
Create a function that takes a two-dimensional array where:

... and returns an array of the quickest route out of the carpark.
___
arr = [
  [1, 0, 0, 0, 2],
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
]

// Starting from 2, move to left 4 times = "L4"
// Go down from stairs 1 step = "D1"
// Move to right 4 times to exit from right bottom corner = "R4"

result = ["L4", "D1", "R4"]
_____

See the below examples to better understand:


[Examples]

___
parking_exit([
  [1, 0, 0, 0, 2],
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
]) ➞ ["L4", "D1", "R4"]
_____

___
parking_exit([
  [2, 0, 0, 1, 0],
  [0, 0, 0, 1, 0],
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
