####  Balanced Array  ####

Given an array of unknown length, but with an even amount of elements (numbers), copy the half with the highest sum of numbers to the other half of the array. If the sum of the first half equals the sum of the second half, return the original array.


[Examples]

___
balanced([1, 2, 4, 6, 3, 1]) ➞ [6, 3, 1, 6, 3, 1]

balanced([88, 3, 27, 5, 9, 0, 13, 10]) ➞ [88, 3, 27, 5, 88, 3, 27, 5]

balanced([7, 5, 2, 6, 1, 0, 1, 5, 2, 7, 0, 6]) ➞ [7, 5, 2, 6, 1, 0, 1, 5, 2, 7, 0, 6]
