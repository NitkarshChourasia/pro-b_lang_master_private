####  Dakti 🌊🌴  ####

Juan loves the Dakti song and wants to memorize the chorus of the song. His friend sent him the chorus in phrases, but the phrases are somewhat strange; they do not have an order and they have numbers. His friend helps Juan organize the chorus of the song.
Use RegEx, natural sorting, sorting, or lambda functions; your imagination has no limits.
First, organize the words based on the numbers they have, then delete the numbers once they are organized.
Three steps:
___
"worl2d hell1o " ➞ " hell1o worl2d " ➞ " hello world "

"i2s th1s a3 t4est    " ➞ "th1is i2s a3 t4est" ➞ "this is a test"

"yo2u cr3azy a1re ?  " ➞  "a1re yo2u cr3azy" ➞ "are you crazy"
