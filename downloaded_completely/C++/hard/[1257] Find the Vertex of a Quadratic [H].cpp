####  Find the Vertex of a Quadratic  ####

Every quadratic curve y = a x² + b x + c has a vertex point: the turning point where the curve stops heading down and starts going up.
Given the values a, b and c, you need to return the coordinates of the vertex. Return your answers rounded to 2 decimal places.


[Examples]

___
findVertex(1, 0, 25)  ➞ [0, 25]
// The vertex of y=x²+25 is at (0, 25).

findVertex(-1, 0, 25) ➞ [0, 25]
// The vertex of y=-x²+25 is at (0, 25).

findVertex(1, 10, 4) ➞ [-5, -21]
// The vertex of y=x²+10x+4 is at (-5, -21).

[Notes]

___
*) See Resources if you're not sure how to find the x or y coordinates of the vertex.
*) a will always be non-zero.

The general form of a quadratic is "y = ax2 + bx + c". For graphing, the leading coefficient "a" indicates how "fat" or how "skinny" the parabola will be.
