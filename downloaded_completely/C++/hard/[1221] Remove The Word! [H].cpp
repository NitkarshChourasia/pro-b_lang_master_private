Create a function that takes an array and string. The function should remove the letters in the string from the array, and return the array.


[Examples]

___
removeLetters(["s", "t", "r", "i", "n", "g", "w"], "string") ➞ ["w"]

removeLetters(["b", "b", "l", "l", "g", "n", "o", "a", "w"], "balloon") ➞ ["b", "g", "w"]

removeLetters(["d", "b", "t", "e", "a", "i"], "edabit") ➞ []

*) If all the letters in the array are used in the string, the function should return an empty array (see example #3).
