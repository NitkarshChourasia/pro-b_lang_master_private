####  Find the Other Two Side Lengths  ####

Given the shortest side of a 30° by 60° by 90° triangle, find out the other two sides. Return the longest side and medium-length side in that order.


[Examples]

___
otherSides(1) ➞ [2.0, 1.73]

otherSides(12) ➞ [24.0, 20.0]

otherSides(2) ➞ [4.0, 3.46]

otherSides(3) ➞ [6.0, 5.2]
_____



[Notes]

___
*) 30° by 60° by 90° triangles always follow this rule: let's say the shortest side length is x units, the hypotenuse would be 2x units and the other side would be x * square root of 3.
*) The results in the Tests are rounded up to 2 decimal places.
*) Return the result as an array.
