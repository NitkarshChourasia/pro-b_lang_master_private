####  The Empty Square Sequence  ####

In the image below, squares are either empty or filled with a circle.

Create a function that takes a number step (which equals HALF the width of a square) and returns the amount of empty squares. The image shows the squares with step 1, 2 and 3. The return value is the number of cells not on a diagonal, which is 0 for the first square, 8 for the second, and 24 for the third.


[Examples]

___
emptySq(1) ➞ 0

emptySq(3) ➞ 24

emptySq(10) ➞ 360
_____



[Notes]

___
*) Test input will always be a positive integer.
*) The width of the square will always be even.
___
