####  Nth Star Number  ####

Create a method that takes a positive integer n and returns the nth "star number".
A star number is a centered figurate number that represents a centered hexagram (six-pointed star), such as the one that Chinese checkers is played on.



[Examples]

___
starNumber(2) ➞ 13
// n = 2
// 2nd star number = 13

starNumber(3) ➞ 37
// n = 3
// 3rd star number = 37

starNumber(5) ➞ 121
// n = 5
// 5th star number = 121
