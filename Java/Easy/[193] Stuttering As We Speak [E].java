####  Stuttering As We Speak  ####

You stutter when you talk with continued repetition of sounds almost unknowingly, especially with the initial consonants of a word. Or at times when we're frightened, it causes us to stutter.
Create a function that mimics the stuttering of a spoken word. The function will repeat the first two letters of the word followed by an ellipses (...) plus a space character, for twice in a row, and finally, the word ending with an exclamation point.


[Examples]

___
stuttering("astonishing") ➞ "as... as... astonishing!"

stuttering("enticing") ➞ "en... en... enticing!"

stuttering("dazzling") ➞ "da... da... dazzling!"
_____

*) In lieu to String.format, the use of MessageFormat.format is greatly encouraged.
*) Check out the Resources tab for more details on formatting strings in Java.
