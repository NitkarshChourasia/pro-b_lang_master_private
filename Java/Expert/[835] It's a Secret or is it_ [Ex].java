/*
####  It's a Secret... or is it?  ####

Given an instance of the NonSuspiciousObject class, return its secretVar attribute.


[Examples]

___
getSecretVar(new NonSuspiciousObject(9)) ➞ 9

getSecretVar(new NonSuspiciousObject(31)) ➞ 31

getSecretVar(new NonSuspiciousObject(-497)) ➞ -497
_____



[Notes]

___
*) The secretVar attribute is private!
*) The tests are randomized; the challenge isn't to reverse engineer the PRNG.
*) The import statement at the top of the "Code" tab should give you a hint.
*) If you're stuck, try looking at the docs for the imported class mentioned above — it has some handy methods! ;)
