####  English to Pig Latin Translator  ####

Pig latin has two very simple rules:

Write two functions to make an English to pig latin translator. The first function translateWord(word) takes a single word and returns that word translated into pig latin. The second function translateSentence(sentence) takes an English sentence and returns that sentence translated into pig latin.


[Examples]

___
translateWord("flag") ➞ "agflay"

translateWord("Apple") ➞ "Appleyay"

translateWord("button") ➞ "uttonbay"

translateWord("") ➞ ""

translateSentence("I like to eat honey waffles.") ➞ "Iyay ikelay otay eatyay oneyhay afflesway."

translateSentence("Do you think it is going to rain today?") ➞ "Oday ouyay inkthay ityay isyay oinggay otay ainray odaytay?"
_____



[Notes]

___
*) Regular expressions will help you not mess up the punctuation in the sentence.
*) If the original word or sentence starts with a capital letter, the translation should preserve its case (see examples #2, #5 and #6).
