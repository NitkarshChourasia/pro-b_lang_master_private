####  Almost Palindrome  ####

A string is an almost-palindrome if, by changing only one character, you can make it a palindrome. Create a function that returns true if a string is an almost-palindrome and false otherwise.


[Examples]

___
almostPalindrome("abcdcbg") ➞ true
// Transformed to "abcdcba" by changing "g" to "a".

almostPalindrome("abccia") ➞ true
// Transformed to "abccba" by changing "i" to "b".

almostPalindrome("abcdaaa") ➞ false
// Can't be transformed to a palindrome in exactly 1 turn.

almostPalindrome("1234312") ➞ false
_____



[Notes]

Return false if the string is already a palindrome.
