####  Alphabetically Sorted  ####

A word is alphabetically sorted if all of the letters in it are in consecutive alphabetical order. Some examples of alphabetically sorted words: abhors (a is before b, b is before h, h is before o, etc.), ghost, accent, hoop.
Create a function that takes in a sentence as input and returns true if there is at least one alphabetically sorted word inside that has a minimum length of 3.


[Examples]

___
isAlphabeticallySorted("Paula has a French accent.") ➞ true
// "accent" is alphabetically sorted.

isAlphabeticallySorted("The biopsy returned negative results.") ➞ true
// "biopsy" is alphabetically sorted.

isAlphabeticallySorted("She sells sea shells by the sea shore.") ➞ false
// Although "by" is alphabetically sorted, it is only 2 letters long.
