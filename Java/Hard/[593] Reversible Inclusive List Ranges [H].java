####  Reversible Inclusive List Ranges  ####

Write a function that, given the start and end values, returns an array containing all the numbers inclusive to that range. See examples below.


[Examples]

___
reversibleInclusiveList(1, 5) ➞ [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

reversibleInclusiveList(2, 8) ➞ [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]

reversibleInclusiveList(10, 20) ➞[10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20]

reversibleInclusiveList(24, 17) ➞[24, 23, 22, 21, 20, 19, 18, 17]
_____



[Notes]

___
*) The sort order of the resulting array is dependent of the input values.
*) All inputs provided in the test scenarios are valid.
*) If start is greater than end, return a descendingly sorted array, otherwise, ascendingly sorted.
*) A recursive version of this challenge can be found in here.
