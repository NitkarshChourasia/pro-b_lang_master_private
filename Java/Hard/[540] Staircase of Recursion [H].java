####  Staircase of Recursion  ####

Write a function that returns the number of ways a person can climb n stairs, where the person may only climb 1 or 2 steps at a time.
To illustrate, if n = 4 there are 5 ways to climb:
___
[1, 1, 1, 1]
[2, 1, 1]
[1, 2, 1]
[1, 1, 2]
[2, 2]
_____



[Examples]

___
waysToClimb(1) ➞ 1

waysToClimb(2) ➞ 2

waysToClimb(5) ➞ 8
_____



[Notes]

A staircase of height 0 should return 1.
