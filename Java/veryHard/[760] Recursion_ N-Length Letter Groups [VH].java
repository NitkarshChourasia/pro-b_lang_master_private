/*
####  Recursion: N-Length Letter Groups  ####

Write a function that returns an array of strings populated from the slices of n-length characters of the given word (a slice after another while n-length applies onto the word).


[Examples]

___
collect("intercontinentalisationalism", 6) 
➞ ["ationa", "interc", "ntalis", "ontine"]

collect("strengths", 3) 
➞ ["eng", "str", "ths"]

collect("pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis", 15) 
➞ ["croscopicsilico", "pneumonoultrami", "volcanoconiosis"]
_____



[Notes]

___
*) Ensure that the resulting array is lexicographically ordered.
*) Return an empty array if the given string is less than n.
*) You are expected to solve this challenge via a recursive approach.
*) You can check on the Resources tab for more details about recursion in Java.
*) An iterative version of this challenge can be found via this link.
