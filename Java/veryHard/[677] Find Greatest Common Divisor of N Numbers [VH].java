/*
####  Find Greatest Common Divisor of N Numbers  ####

Create a function that takes an array of numbers and returns the greatest common factor of those numbers.


[Examples]

___
gcd({84, 70, 42, 56}) ➞ 14

gcd({19, 38, 76, 133}) ➞ 19

gcd({120, 300, 95, 425, 625}) ➞ 5
_____



[Notes]

The GCD is the largest factor that divides all numbers in the array.
